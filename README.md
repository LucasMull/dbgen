Fake data generator for testing, simulating and learning purposes. 

My aim is to create a library which I can use throughout my college term, so that I can easily generate fake stored data for manipulation.

There should be some documentation coming when I do learn how to make one properly, until then I'll just keep on commenting everything that's relevant.
