Fake data generator for testing, simulating and learning purposes. 

My aim is to create a library which I can use throughout my college term, so that I can easily generate fake stored data for manipulation.

There should be some documentation coming when I do learn how to make a proper one, until then I'll just keep on commenting everything that's relevant.

IMPORTANT NOTES#-
        -type 'make' to create the executable, and 'make clean' before recompiling again

        -fake data generated will be stored in data.csv by default

        -main.c is simply and example code to go by, all the relevant functions are located in src/

        -content folder is a folder containing pre-created data to be manipulated in the code, there is a name.txt and surname.txt stored there by
         default, which I use to generate ficticious names in main.c
